# TTS overlay plus

An autohotkey TTS overlay with code from [altbdoor](https://github.com/altbdoor/ahk-tts) and [Rejdukien](https://github.com/Rejdukien/autohotkey-tts-overlay)

# Why fork?
I wanted to change a few things and fix some breaking bugs.
And since this is the best TTS overlay i could find on the internet, i figured i would just publish the changes.
